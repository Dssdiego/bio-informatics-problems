# Welcome

This is my personal repository for solutions of the [ROSALIND Bio Informatics Problems](http://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/).

My goal here was to learn bioinformatics while getting better at python and haskell; so, choose your path:

üêç [Python](https://github.com/Dssdiego/bio-informatics-problems/tree/master/python)

‚ô¶Ô∏è [Haskell](https://github.com/Dssdiego/bio-informatics-problems/tree/master/haskell/)

All my folders are structured just as ROSALIND's folder structure (Armory, Stronghold, etc)

Enjoy!
